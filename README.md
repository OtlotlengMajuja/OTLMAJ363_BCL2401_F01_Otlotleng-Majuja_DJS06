### DJS06 Project: Higher Order Functions

## Introduction

In order to complete this challenge, I had to manipulate data using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more, to perform a variety of tasks. It was necessary for me to focus on using these techniques to overcome challenging issues and accomplish goals.

## Disclaimer

I'll make every effort to steer clear of any further disclaimers in projects down the road. But you may have noticed that my code for Exercise 6 in scripts.js does not include the `some` method in my code. I searched W3Schools, MDN, and Stack Overflow extensively, but I was unable to figure out how to apply it to my code.

## Project Overview

There was not a set objective, besides following the given set of instructions, that encouraged me to make use of higher-order functions to manipulate the data using the declarative approach.
