### DJS06 Project: Higher Order Functions

## Introduction

In order to complete this challenge, I had to manipulate data using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more, to perform a variety of tasks. It was necessary for me to focus on using these techniques to overcome challenging issues and accomplish goals.

## Disclaimer

I'll make every effort to steer clear of any further disclaimers in projects down the road. But you may have noticed that my code for Exercise 6 in scripts.js does not include the `some` method in my code. I searched W3Schools, MDN, and Stack Overflow extensively, but I was unable to figure out how to apply it to my code.

## Project Overview

There was not a set objective, besides following the given set of instructions, that encouraged me to make use of higher-order functions to manipulate the data using the declarative approach.

## Elements Included

**Logging Product Names:** Every product name is logged when you iterate through the products array.

**Filtering by Name Length:** Filtering products to include only those whose names have five characters or less.

**Price Manipulation:** Filtering out products without valid prices, converting string prices to numbers, and calculating the overall cost.

**Concatenating Product Names:** Using `reduce` to concatenate all product names into a single string.

**Finding Extremes in Prices:** Finding the most and least expensive products, then formatting the result as a string.

**Object Transformation:** Using Object.entries and `reduce` to recreate the products object with keys 'name' and 'cost'.

## Reflections

**Array Methods:** Mastery in using array methods such as forEach, filter, map, and `reduce` to manipulate and transform data.
**Destructuring:** Using destructuring to simplify code and access object properties.
**Mathematical Operations:** Calculating totals and finding maximum and minimum values within an array.

### Areas of Mastery

### Challenges Faced

Managing mixed data types, which mostly involved working with prices saved as strings and numbers as well as empty strings and spaces, was one component of this project that I found difficult. Another was making sure the right filter requirements were satisfied in order to omit invalid data, and making sure the complicated transformations and transformation procedures kept the original data values intact by appropriately using the higher-order functions.

### Overall Learning Experience

I tried to make sure that my code was as clean as possible, even though I might not have handled the higher-order functions the way they were intended to be handled. Using `forEach` to iterate over arrays and log data confirmed my understanding of basic iteration techniques. I was relieved to see references to ideas I knew well, like as `map` and `reduce`, and how to use them to change data. Applying mathematical functions to real-world data circumstances is something I learned how to do by identifying the extreme values inside the arrays.
